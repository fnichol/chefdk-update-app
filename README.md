# appbundle-updater

Helper to update Chef and Chef-DK appbundle'd apps inside of an omnibus bundle.

## Requirements

* A ChefDK or Chef Client installation in the standard location.
* You need to have the `git` command in your PATH.

## Usage Examples

Install as a gem:

```
gem install appbundle-updater
```

Updating chef in the /opt/chefdk bundle to master:

```
sudo appbundle-updater chefdk chef master
```

Updating chef-dk in the /opt/chefdk bundle to master (sorry about the inconsistent dashes here
but the project/gem is called "chef-dk" while the path on the filesystem is /opt/chefdk, the
path on the filesystem comes first):

```
sudo appbundle-updater chefdk chef-dk master
```

Updating various other softwares in /opt/chefdk bundle to master:

```
sudo appbundle-updater chefdk berkshelf master
sudo appbundle-updater chefdk chef-vault master
sudo appbundle-updater chefdk ohai master
sudo appbundle-updater chefdk foodcritic master
sudo appbundle-updater chefdk test-kitchen master
```

Updating chef and ohai in the /opt/chef bundle to master:

```
sudo appbundle-updater chef chef master
sudo appbundle-updater chef ohai master
```

Windows users from PowerShell use the bat file:

```powershell
& appbundle-updater chefdk test-kitchen master
```

If you don't want "master" you can use any other git tag/branch/sha/etc that git understands.

## Execution and Target rubies

This does not need to be installed into the embedded ruby that you are doing the update on.

You can install this into an rvm gemset as a local user (for example) and run:

```
rvmsudo appbundle-updater chef chef master
```

It will invoke appbundle-updater via rvm (using your user ruby+gemset under sudo), but will
correctly break the bundle and setup the PATH in order to manipulate your /opt/chefdk or
/opt/chef ruby environment.

Only tested with RVM, but chruby and rbenv are usually simpler and easier.
